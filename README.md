# Bulk Barn vs. Brand Price Comparisons
This project's goal is to see which of the two, Bulk Barn bulk prices or 
the average of a brand's prices, are cheaper. By comparing the prices, 
it will be shown:
1. Which is cheaper when a small amount is bought,
2. Which remains cheaper as the amount bought is fairly large, and
3. If one becomes cheaper as the amount bought increases.

# Requirements
This project requires the following libraries and their dependencies:
`matplotlib`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.
Python is the primary language used in this project, and all data is 
stored in `JSON` format (`CSV` could also be used and will be provided).
Since prices may differ between Bulk Barn (shorthand BB) stores, the 
prices used in this project are from the following store:
*Bulk Barn, 265-2 The Boardwalk, Waterloo, ON*
from 12:00 to 17:00 on Sunday, April 7, 2019.
